# Fibo-Indicator
The aim of this project is to mimic the Fibonacci Indicator used in investing/day trading.  Currently, when provided with OHLC market data, this indicator finds each of the trends, consisting of the highest highs and the lowest lows. It then calculates fibonacci for these trends. 

This project is still a work in progress. More information will be provided as I go along.
